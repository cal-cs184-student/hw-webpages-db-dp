		<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				This homework assignment was based on building a cloth simulator. The goal was to realistically model
				cloth behavior under different physical forces, collisions, and lighting conditions. In Part 1, we
				implemented a grid-based / mass-spring system to represent the cloth's geometry. This allowed us to
				simulate individual point masses connected by structural, shearing, and bending springs. In Part 2, we
				used Newton's laws to simulate how external forces like gravity affect the cloth. Here, we had to update
				point mass positions using Verlet integration while enforcing spring constraints. Part 3 introduced
				collisions with other primitives like spheres and planes. This part involved making sure that the cloth
				properly responded to and slid across surfaces using geometric correction and friction. We continued in
				Part 4 by implementing spatial hashing to detect and resolve self-collisions. This allowed the cloth to
				fold, crumple, and interact with itself more realistically. Part 5 was the final section, where we moved
				on to shading. We implemented fragment shaders such as diffuse, Blinn-Phong, texture mapping, bump
				mapping, displacement mapping, and mirror reflection using a cubemap. One of the things that we both
				found incredibly interesting in this homework assignment was the visual simulations. These simulations
				allowed us to debug more efficiently, and it made implementing features, such as adding wind force from
				the extra credit section, really fun.

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
			<p>
				As mentioned in our overview section, Part 2 involved implementing the physics behind cloth simulation
				using external forces and spring-based internal constraints. The following is a comparison of simulating
				scene/pinned4.json at different values for spring constant, density, and damping.
			</p>
			<p>
				We first experimented with the spring constant ks, which controls the stiffness of the springs
				connecting point masses. The low spring constant value that we chose was 1 N/m. Running the simulation
				at this value made the cloth appear overly elastic and unstable. Also, the cloth never fully came to
				rest and continued to oscillate subtly because it couldn't resist deformation. The high spring constant
				value that we chose was 10000 N/m. This produced a much stiffer cloth. The cloth also sagged less than
				with the default value of 5000 N/m and most of the wrinkles disappeared.
			</p>
			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px; width: 100%;">
				<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; width: 33%;">
					<img src="figure_2_1.png" style="width: 100%;"/>
					<p><b>Figure 2.1 </b><small>Spring Constant: 1 N/m</small></p>
				</div>
				<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; width: 33%;">
					<img src="figure_2_2.png" style="width: 100%;"/>
					<p><b>Figure 2.2 </b><small>Spring Constant: 10000 N/m</small></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				The next comparison we experimented with is the effect of changing the cloth's density. The low density
				value we chose was 1 g/cm^2. Here, the cloth showed little sagging and settled quickly. This is because
				the cloth now has a lighter mass, which means that external forces had less influence. Most of the
				winkles had also disappeared at this point. The high density value that we chose was 30 g/cm^2, which is
				double the default value. This higher value made the cloth noticeably heavier, and it sagged
				significantly more under its own weight. The cloth still kept its structure because of spring forces,
				but it was clearly being pulled down more strongly by gravity.
			</p>
			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px; width: 100%;">
				<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; width: 33%;">
					<img src="figure_2_3.png" style="width: 100%;"/>

					<p><b>Figure 2.4 </b><small>Density: 30 g/cm^2</small></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				The last comparison we did was selecting different values of damping. The low damping value we chose was
				0%, which caused the cloth to swing back and forth dramatically. The cloth also took an extremely long
				time to settle. We actually had to slightly increase damping to 0.02% just to help the cloth settle
				quicker because of how persistent the movement was at 0%. The high damping value we chose was 1%. This
				caused the cloth to fall much more slowly, essentially feather-like without any swinging motion. This
				showed us how high damping values smooth out motion and quickly dissipate energy.

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
			<p>
				This part of the homework involved collision handling between a cloth and external objects.
				Specifically, we added support for collisions with both spheres and planes. For spheres, we first
				determined whether a point mass had intersected the sphere by checking its position relative to the
				sphere's origin and radius. If a collision occurred, we computed a correction vector to move the point
				mass back onto the sphere's surface. This allowed us to apply friction to slightly dampen its motion. For
				planes, we detected whether a point mass had crossed over the plane between time steps. When a collision
				was detected, the point was projected back onto the plane with a small offset to prevent repeated
				collisions. We also updated the point's last position to reduce unwanted bouncing caused by residual
				velocity.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following figures show a comparison of simulating scene/sphere.json with three different spring
				constants: 500 N/m, 5000 N/m, and 50000 N/m. With 500 N/m, the cloth looked highly flexible, and it sagged
				lower onto the sphere. The folds that formed were also thin and closely spaced. This lower stiffness
				caused the cloth to conform more tightly to the shape of the sphere. At the default 5000 N/m, the cloth
				sagged less and kept its folds, but they were wider and less frequent. The cloth also looked more
				natural in which it did not appear to cling as much to the sphere. At 50000 N/m, the cloth became much
				stiffer. It sagged very little and formed only a few thick folds. All three screenshots were taken from
				the same viewing angle, and the sphere itself even became partially visible at this stiffer spring
				constant. In a way, the cloth resembled the appearance of a thick napkin.

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
			<p>
				Part 4 involved the implementation of self-collision handling to prevent the cloth from intersecting and
				passing through itself. Initially, running the simulation using scene/selfCollision.json would show a
				cloth falling and unnaturally clipping through its own folds and layers. To solve this problem, we used
				spatial hashing to detect nearby point masses that might be in contact. We began by dividing the 3D
				space into fixed-size boxes. We then created a hash function to uniquely identify each box. During each
				simulation step, we built a spatial map that linked each hash key with a list of point masses contained
				within that box. When checking for collisions, each point mass only needed to be compared with other
				masses in its own hash bucket. If two masses were found to be closer than double the thickness, a
				correction vector would be applied to sort out the intersection. We also scaled down the correction by
				the number of simulation sub-steps to avoid unnatural large movements.
			</p>
			<p>
				The figures below show how the cloth folds on itself over time. The first screenshot shows an initial
				self-collision, the second shows the cloth at which most of it has self-collided, and the third shows a
				more restful state.
			</p>
			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px; width: 100%;">
				<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; width: 33%;">
					<img src="figure_4_1.png" style="width: 100%;"/>
					<p><b>Figure 4.1 </b><small>Initial collision</small></p>

					<img src="figure_4_3.png" style="width: 100%;"/>
					<p><b>Figure 4.3 </b><small>Resting State</small></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				We also tested how self-collisions behave under different physical conditions by varying both the
				cloths density and spring constant.
			</p>
			<p>
				With a low density of 1 g/cm^2, the cloth had less mass and experienced fewer self-collisions. The folds
				that formed were large and widely spaced. The cloth also settled with only a few thick curves. With a
				high density of 30 g/cm^2, the cloth appeared much heavier and showed a more dramatic folding behavior.
				We also noticed that there were more tighter and thinner folds as the cloth crumpled onto itself. This
				is because the greater mass increases internal interactions.
			</p>
			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px; width: 100%;">
				<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; width: 33%;">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				For spring constants, a low value of 1 N/m led to a soft and floppy-like cloth. This cloth sagged and
				folded more extensively. The cloth also took a noticeably long time to settle, with lots of motion and
				fine wrinkles forming as it tried to come to a rest. A high spring constant of 10000 N/m made the cloth
				much stiffer. It formed fewer folds, but those folds were thicker and more defined.

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
			<p>
				The final section of this homework is about how lighting and material effects are simulated in real time
				using shader programs. A shader is a small program that runs on the GPU and controls how surfaces appear
				on screen. We specifically worked with vertex shaders and fragment shaders as part of this homework
				assignment. The vertex shader is responsible for transforming each vertex's position from object space
				into screen space. It also prepares per-vertex attributes like normals, tangents, and UV coordinates,
				which are passed along to the fragment shader through interpolated outputs. On the other hand, the
				fragment shader runs once per pixel and uses the interpolated data to compute the final color of that
				pixel. Lighting models, texture sampling, and other surface effects are applied at this stage. Combining
				these two shaders make it possible to simulate lighting and materials efficiently.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the lighting models that we implemented was Blinn-Phong shading. This type of shading breaks up
				lighting by ambient, diffuse, and specular. Ambient accounts for indirect light and ensures the surface
				isn't completely dark in the absence of direct light. Diffuse is based on Lambert's cosine law and
				simulates how light scatters across a rough surface. It specifically depends on the angle between the
				light direction and the surface normal. Specular simulates shiny highlights using a half vector and a
				shininess exponent to control the size and intensity of the reflection.

				and cloth.

			<p>
				We also implemented both bump mapping and displacement mapping. The figures below show our functional
				implementation using textures/texture_4.png on both the sphere and cloth. Additionally, we used the
				default staff values for both the Normal and Height parameters.
			</p>
			<p>
				With bump mapping, we changed the surface normals based on local height differences sampled from the
				texture. This gave the illusion of surface details such as bumps and ridges without changing the
				foundational geometry. When applied to the cloth and sphere, the bump mapping created realistic
				variations of texture under lighting. For example, three different styles of blocks are shown when using
				textures/texture_4.png. One appears fairly smooth with minimal texture, another appears slightly
				elevated, and the last appears to have a texture similar to that of a bandage.
			</p>
			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px; width: 100%;">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				In contrast, displacement mapping involved modifying the actual positions of the vertices using the same
				height values. This resulted in real geometric deformation. Some of the differences that are most
				noticeable are the jagged edges that appear on the sphere and the swollen-like look of the cloth.
			</p>
			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px; width: 100%;">
				<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; width: 33%;">

					<p><b>Figure 5.10 </b><small>Displacement Mapping on Cloth</small></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				Additionally, we tested both our bump and displacement shaders under different mesh resolutions by
				varying the coarseness of the sphere and cloth geometry. Specifically, we used the -o 16 -a 16 and -o
				128 -a 128 flags to render the same textured surface at low and high levels of mesh detail.
			</p>
			<p>
				With bump mapping, the results remained fairly consistent across all mesh resolutions. At both 16 and
				128, the bumps appeared smooth and lit, while the sphere's shape remained well rounded. We ultimately
				felt that there were very little visual differences between the renders at low, medium, or high
				resolution.
			</p>
			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px; width: 100%;">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				The differences were much more noticeable with displacement mapping. At 16, the sphere appeared smoother
				overall, with less jagged deformation. In comparison, the sphere appeared to have a rougher and more
				crinkled surface at 128. The reason for this is that the higher resolution mesh allowed the displacement
				shader to push and pull the geometry in greater detail.

			<h3>Extra Credit - Custom Shader</h3>
			<p>
				This custom shader has a heatmap effect that visualizes the cloth's height using color. It maps
				the vertical position of each fragment to a color gradient ranging from blue (low) to red (high). In
				other words, it gives a real time visualization of elevation throughout the simulation.
