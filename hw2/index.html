		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>This homework assignment involved the implementation of some geometry processing operations using the half-edge data structure. Specifically, we focused on Bezier curve evaluation, mesh editing, and Loop subdivision. In Part 1 and 2, we implemented de Casteljau's algorithm to evaluate Bezier curves and surfaces. This ultimately allowed us to recursively compute interpolated points to generate smooth and scalable shapes. Part 3 differed as we began to work with area-weighted vertex normals. The end goal here was to improve shading quality in rendered meshes by computing smooth normals based on neighboring face areas. Moving on to Part 4 and 5, these parts focused on edge flipping and splitting. One of the most important things when implementing these was that they required careful pointer management. This is because we needed to make sure that all half-edges, vertices, and faces remained correctly connected. Lastly, we finished off the assignment by implementing loop subdivision in Part 6. This part taught us how iterative subdivision progressively transforms wiry meshes into smoother and high-resolution models. An interesting part of this assignment actually has to do about subdivision. We both found it incredibly interesting to view with our own eyes how loop subdivision can take a simple shape and transform it into a much more complex and higher quality surface.</p>

		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
			<p>De Casteljau's algorithm is a way  to compute points on Bezier curves and divide them into smaller segments in an iterative way. The way this is done is by linearly interpolating between control points. For example, given a set of control points and a parameter t, where 0 &le; t &le; 1, the algorithm repeatedly computes new intermediate points using weighted averages at each step. The number of points then gets reduced until only a single point remains. This final point represents the position on the Bezier curve at the given parameter. The process here essentially subdivides the curve into smaller segments, which makes it useful for rendering and refining curves. The way de Casteljau's algorithm was implemented in our code was through the function BezierCurve::evaluateStep(...) in student_code.cpp. This function takes a set of 2D control points and computes interpolated points using the given parameter t. After, it performs one step of interpolation by iterating over the input points and applying the de Casteljau formula to generate a reduced set of points. We then implemented evaluate1D(...), which recursively calls evaluateStep(...) until only one point remains. We finished off our implementation by using ./meshedit ../bzc/curve1.bzc to visually step through the recursive process in a GUI.</p>

				0.900 0.100
			</div>
			<p>Figure 1.1 shows the initial control points that form the structure of the curve. As we step through the algorithm, each upcoming figure shows how intermediate control points are being recursively interpolated. These steps continue to refine the curve until the final Bezier point is computed. Once all the points were evaluated, we used the GUI controls to show the full Bezier curve. Figure 1.8 shows how modifying the control points and adjusting the parameter t dynamically changes the curve's shape.</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
			<p>De Casteljau's algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces by applying the 1D interpolation process twice. Specifically, it is once applied along the u direction and then again along the v direction. This part differed from the last because a Bezier surface is defined by a grid of control points instead of a single sequence. This means that you first need to compute intermediate points by doing de Casteljau's subdivision across each row at a given u parameter. The row of points that result from this is then further interpolated in the v direction. A single evaluated point on the surface is then produced. Our implementation of Bezier surface evaluation first involved modifying BezierPatch::evaluateStep(...) to perform one iteration of de Casteljau's algorithm in 3D space. This was done in order to compute intermediate control points via linear interpolation. We then modified evaluate1D(...) by recursively applying evaluateStep(...) to compute a final single interpolated point along one direction. Our last task was in evaluate(...), where we used two passes of evaluate1D(...). The first pass was to interpolate each row at a given u and the second pass was to interpolate the resulting points in the v direction. This gave the final surface point. Testing here was done using ./meshedit ../bez/teapot.bez to see the surface rendering.</p>

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
			<p>We implemented area-weighted vertex normals in Vertex::normal() by first iterating through all neighboring faces of a vertex and computing their weighted normals. We then traversed each adjacent triangle using the halfedge data structure. This allowed us to extract its three vertices and compute its face normal using the cross product of two triangle edges. We then made sure to weight the face normal by the triangle's area to make sure that larger faces contributed more to the final normal. The final step was to sum the weighted normals and normalize the final result to produce a unit normal vector. We finished off by using ./meshedit ../dae/teapot.dae to test between flat shading and Phong shading by pressing the Q key.</p>
			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px; width: 100%;">
				<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; width: 48%;">

					<p><b>Figure 3.2</b> <small>Phong shading applied to the teapot mesh.</small></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Figure 3.1 shows how flat shading is applied to the teapot mesh. The sharp edges and blocky look result from each triangle having a single normal. Figure 3.2 shows how Phong shading is also applied to the teapot mesh. The smooth interpolated normals in this figure allow the light reflections to look more natural and less fragmented.</p>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
			<p>This task involved modifying the HalfedgeMesh::flipEdge(...) function to implement the edge flip operation. This function is essentially in charge of reconfiguring the connectivity of two adjacent triangles that share an edge. For instance, it first begins by checking if the edge is on a boundary. If it is on a boundary, it returns early since boundary edges cannot be flipped. It then retrieves all relevant mesh elements such as half-edges, vertices, edges, and faces by using the half-edge data structure. In order to make the flip possible, we had to reassign the half-edge pointers to reflect the new triangle configuration. This was done to make sure that each vertex, edge, and face properly referenced its updated neighbors. The final step was to update the vertex pointers to reflect the flipped configuration to make sure that the mesh structure does not change.</p>
			<p>One of the challenges we had in implementing this task was making sure that all pointers remained valid after flipping the edge. What we did to tackle this problem was print half-edge and vertex relationships before / after the flip operation as a way to debug. This allowed us to check whether all elements were correctly being reassigned. Additionally, we used isBoundary() to prevent accidental modifications to edges on the mesh boundary. We also made sure to follow the website suggestions by repeatedly flipping an edge as another way to debug. This allowed us to visually see whether the meshes were remaining stable after repeated flips.</p>
			<div style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
				before flip - v0: { 1, 1, 1 }, h0 vertex: { 1, 1, 1 }, h2 vertex: { -1, 1, 1 } <br>
				after flip - v0: { 1, 1, 1 }, h0 vertex: { 1, 1, -1 }, h2 vertex: { 1, 1, 1 } <br>
				before flip - v0: { 1, 1, -1 }, h0 vertex: { 1, 1, -1 }, h2 vertex: { 1, 1, 1 } <br>
				after flip - v0: { 1, 1, -1 }, h0 vertex: { -1, 1, -1 }, h2 vertex: { 1, 1, -1 }
			</div>
			<p>The above shows an example of our debugger output after flipping the same edge twice.</p>
			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px; width: 100%;">
				<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; width: 48%;">

					<p><b>Figure 4.2</b> <small>Mesh configuration after performing edge flips.</small></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>The figures above show a before and after of the edge flip operation on a mesh. We again used the teapot illustration by running ./meshedit ../dae/teapot.dae and hit the F key after selecting an edge to run the flip operation. Figure 4.1 shows the original mesh configuration before applying edge flips, with edges forming adjacent triangles in their initial state. Figure 4.2 shows the effects of performing several edge flips towards the middle of the teapot. The shared edges here have essentially been reoriented, modifying the local mesh structure while keeping the same number of vertices, edges, and faces.</p>

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
			<p>Implementing the edge split operation involved multiple steps to complete this task. For starters, we began by modifying HalfedgeMesh::splitEdge(...) to first check if the edge is on a boundary. We also used an if case to avoid splitting a boundary, which could've caused buggy behavior. After, we retrieved all necessary mesh elements such as the original half-edges, vertices, edges, and faces that are associated with the edge. The next step was to introduce a new vertex at the midpoint of the selected edge, with its position set as the average of the two original edge vertices. We then created three new edges, six new half-edges, and two new faces to integrate the new vertex into the existing mesh structure. The final steps involved reassigning half-edge pointers and updating face / vertex references. We did this to make sure that every new and existing element was correctly linked, while also ensuring that the new vertex correctly pointed to its outgoing half-edge.</p>
			<p>A challenge that we faced during our implementation process was when we had to make sure that the new vertex was correctly being positioned, and that all newly created half-edges, edges, and faces were being properly linked. A sort of debugging trick / strategy that we did was logging edge split outputs, specifically the positions of the two original edge vertices and the newly created midpoint vertex. This output was useful in verifying that the new vertex was correctly placed at the expected midpoint.</p>

			<p>The above shows an example of our debugger output after splitting multiple edges. It was actually outputted after making Figure 5.3 below.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>The following four figures show the effects of edge splitting and flipping starting from an initial mesh layout. We specifically used the cube figure here using ./meshedit ../dae/cube.dae. Figure 5.1 shows the original cube mesh before any modifications. We then used the S key in Figure 5.2 to apply one split, creating a new vertex at the midpoint of the edge and subdividing it into two smaller triangles. Figure 5.3 simply shows further splits, increasing the triangle count across the mesh. Figure 5.4 lastly shows the result of flipping some of the previously split edges, which was done using the F key.</p>

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
			<p>For starters, we decided to follow the recommended implementation approach from the course website, where we implemented Step A for computing new vertex positions, Step B for subdividing the mesh, and Step C for updating vertex positions. The first thing we did as part of Step A was to precompute new positions for both old vertices and new vertices using loop subdivision rules. For existing vertices, we iterated over all that were adjacent using the half-edge data structure and applied the weighted averaging formula based on the vertex degree n. Here is the specific formula that we used for this step:</p>
			<div style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
				<code>V' = (1 - n * u) * V + u * sum(V_adjacent)</code>
			</div>
			<p>Here, u = 3/16 for degree-3 vertices and u = 3/(8n) for others. We then positioned new vertices by using a weighted sum of their edge endpoints and adjacent vertices using the following formula:</p>
			<div style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
				<code>V_midpoint = (3/8) * (V_A + V_B) + (1/8) * (V_C + V_D)</code>
			</div>
			<p>Both V_A and V_B are the edge endpoints, while V_C and V_D are the opposite vertices. Continuing onto Step B, we stored all original edges and applied edge splits using mesh.splitEdge(e). This allowed us to insert new midpoint vertices with their precomputed positions. It was then in Step C where we flipped edges that connected old and new vertices to improve triangle quality. This allowed us to make sure that the mesh remains in a well enough structure and avoids poorly shaped triangles. The last step to wrap up our implementation was updating all vertex positions using Vertex::newPosition to guarantee that each vertex moved based on the computed loop subdivision rules.</p>
			<p>Our interesting implementation / debugging tricks that we used for this part was fairly similar to those of Part 4 and Part 5. For instance, one thing that we decided to do was print vertex positions before and after subdivision. This allowed us to confirm whether the computed positions were correctly matching the expected loop subdivision formula. We also included several other similar loggers for each of the recommended parts to break down our code even further when debugging. Besides this, we both used the wireframe mode extensively to visually see how the mesh topology was being changed after subdivision. This feature helped us a lot in spotting buggy behavior early on.</p>
			<h4>Effects to Sharp Corners and Edges</h4>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>We observed that sharp edges and corners smooth out significantly when applying loop subdivision. The three figures above demonstrate how pre-splitting a mesh before subdivision can preserve the definition of sharp corners and edges. For instance, we used the torus figure in /meshedit ../dae/torus/input.dae to pre-split one side of the figure, while leaving the other side in its initial state. Afterwards, we applied one subdivision and it was clear that the pre-split side helped retain more of the original sharpness compared to applying subdivision directly. This is because pre-splitting adds additional vertices along edges, preventing them from being pulled inward as aggressively. On the other hand, loop subdivision redistributes vertex positions using weighted averaging, which softens sharp transitions. This evidently caused the side of the torus without pre-splitting to look much flatter and softer.</p>

			</div>
			<p>Figure 6.4 represents the original cube mesh before any loop subdivision is applied. The mesh is perfectly symmetrical at this stage and no smoothing has occurred. As loop subdivision is applied over multiple iterations (Figures 6.5, 6.6, and 6.7), the cube progressively loses its symmetry. This occurs because loop subdivision relies on the initial connectivity of the mesh. In other words, the pre-existing differences in edge lengths and vertex connectivity cause uneven vertex movement.</p>

			<p>In this version of the cube, we applied one edge split per face to create a more balanced initial triangulation. Essentially, the cube now has a uniform X-shaped pattern on each face. This makes sure that all edges have a more even distribution before subdivision begins, which helps prevent overly stretched triangles. As can be seen in the figures above (Figures 6.9, 6.10, and 6.11), the smoothing effect remains evenly distributed across all faces as further subdivisions are applied. We specifically found from our testing that one split per face was both the simplest and most effective in terms of the pre-processing steps that we could take. However, edge flips can also be used to improve symmetry. This is because flipping edges before subdivision can help reorient diagonal connections so that they form more equilateral triangles, which loop subdivision handles more predictably.</p>
